# Hi, I’m Fatih 👋  
**Solution Architect & Software Engineer**

I design and build systems that stay reliable under real-world conditions.  
For more than 14 years, I’ve worked across different teams and countries, helping products grow without unnecessary complexity.

I prefer clear communication, simple diagrams, and writing things down so ideas stay consistent.  
I still code when needed, it keeps me close to the real problems.

## 🧭 What I Focus On

### Solution Architecture
Understanding complex systems, defining service boundaries, and keeping APIs predictable.

### Cloud & Platforms
Kubernetes, IaC, observability, automation — practical engineering that keeps platforms stable.

### Integrations & Data
Event-driven systems, document pipelines, search/indexing, and data workflows that actually help teams.

### Collaboration
Sharing context, removing blockers early, and helping teams work calmly and effectively.
